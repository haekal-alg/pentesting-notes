## SMB
1. enum4linux
	1. What are the shares? 
	2. Do we have anonymous access?
	3. What are the users? Try common credentials
---
## Web
1. File **and** directory fuzzing: `wfuzz`, `gobuster`, `dirb`
	- Fuzz both port 80 and 443.
	- Focus on custom content.
	- Found `cgi-bin`? `.cgi` files could lead to `shellshock`
2. What's the technology/service running on the website?
3. Manual search, go view page source.
	1. Got a login page? try special characters `'`, `;`, `"`. Are there error logs?
4. Vulnerability scanning: `Nikto` (careful, it's very noisy).
5. What vulnerability did you find?
	1. Path Traversal:
		1. Check the log & config file -> varies for some OS.
		2. Check the code -> weak statement, unsanitized inputs, credentials.
	2. LFI:
		1. Log poisoning
		2. If you have arbitrary file upload you can get RCE
		3. If you want to read `.php` file, convert it to base64 first.

Notes:
1. How do you know the difference between `Path Traversal` and `LFI`?
	- By definition, `LFI` INCLUDES the file. So, if you run a native file like index.php, the code inside it will get executed, page will get rendered.
	- `Path Traversal` only READS the content of the file.

## Privilege Escalation
Manual:
1. Are you constrained by jail shell?
2. SUID and GUID?
3. What can current user do `sudo -l`?
4. What's the distro, architecture and kernel version of the machine? to find kernel exploit prioritize distro first. 
5. What's in the home directory?
6. Can you upload/download file?
7.  What processes are run by `root`?
8. Are there something interesting in the `_history` files?
9. Are there ssh keys?
10. Search for files that are named and/or contain the word `password`, `passwd`, `config` or `configuration`.
11. `netstat -antup` what's running on loopback?
