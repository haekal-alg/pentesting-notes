## SQL injection examples
### Retrieving hidden data
Modify an SQL query to return additional results.
Consider the query below that returns an item that is both a gift and has been released (presumably release = 0 would be an item that has not been released).
```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```
Below payload will return all item in any category, both released and unreleased.
<pre style="font-size: 12px";>
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = <font color=red>'</font><b>Gifts' OR 1=1 --</b><font color=red>'</font> AND released = 1
</pre>

### Subverting application logic
Change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
Example: Authentication bypas.
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'
```
Log in as admin.
<pre style="font-size: 12px";>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = <font color=red>'</font><b>1' OR '1'='1</b><font color=red>'</font>
</pre>

### UNION attacks
Retrieve data from different database tables.
You need two requirements:
1. How many columns are being returned from the original query?
2. Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query?

### Examining the database
extract information about the version and structure of the database.
### Blind SQL injection
results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.
