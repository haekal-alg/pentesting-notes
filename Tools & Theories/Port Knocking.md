Port knocking is a stealth method to externally open ports that, by default, the firewall keeps closed. It works by requiring connection attempts to a series of predefined closed ports. With a simple port knocking method, when the correct sequence of port "knocks" (connection attempts) is received, the firewall opens certain port(s) to allow a connection.

When you "knock" on a port you are really just sending TCP-packets with `SYN`-flag to that port. The closed port will then respond with a `ACK/RST`

Config file is usually located at `/etc/knockd.conf`.
```bash
for i in 324 125 235; do nmap -Pn -p $i --host-timeout 201 --max-retries 0 $IP; done
```
- `--host-timeout` -> give up on target after 201 seconds (arbitrary).
- `--max-retries` ->  number of retransmission.

After knock, check if the port's opened.
```
nmap -p 22 #IP
```
