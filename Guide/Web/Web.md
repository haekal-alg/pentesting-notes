# Web
1. File **and** directory fuzzing: `wfuzz`, `gobuster`, `dirb`
	- Fuzz both port 80 and 443.
	- Focus on custom content.
	- Found `cgi-bin`? `.cgi` files could lead to `shellshock`
2. What's the technology/service running on the website?
3. Manual search, go view page source.
	1. Got a login page? try special characters `'`, `;`, `"`. Are there error logs?
4. Vulnerability scanning: `Nikto` (careful, it's very noisy).
5. Got `phpinfo()`? see important information such as `DOCUMENT_ROOT` 

## Vulnerability
### LFI
1. Is it also `RFI`?
2. Can you access the log file? If yes, then log poisoning.
3. If you have arbitrary file upload you chain them to get RCE

Note: If you want to read `.php` file, you need to encode it.

Notes:
1. How do you know the difference between `Path Traversal` and `LFI`?
	- By definition, `LFI` INCLUDES the file. So, if you run a native file like index.php, the code inside it will get executed, page will get rendered.
	- `Path Traversal` only READS the content of the file.
