### Challenge 1: [[ret2win]]
> Locate a method that you want to call within the binary.  Call it by overwriting a saved return address on the stack.

### Challenge 2: [[split]] [50%]
> The elements that allowed you to complete ret2win are still present, they've just been split apart.  Find them and recombine them using a short ROP chain.

We need to call `system()` with the string `/bin/cat flag.txt` as argument that's already provided to us inside the program.

You can do the x86 challenge with just a **2 link chain** and the x86_64 challenge with a **3 link chain**.

### Challenge 3: [[callme]] 
> Reliably make consecutive calls to imported functions. Use some new techniques and learn about the Procedure Linkage Table.

You must call the `callme_one()`, `callme_two()` and `callme_three()` functions in that order, each with the arguments `0xdeadbeef`, `0xcafebabe`, `0xd00df00d`.

**For the x86_64 binary** double up those values, e.g. `callme_one(0xdeadbeefdeadbeef, 0xcafebabecafebabe, 0xd00df00dd00df00d)`

### Challenge 4: [[write4]] 
> Our first foray into proper gadget use.  A useful function is still present, but we'll need to write a string into memory somehow.

A PLT entry for a function named print_file() exists within the challenge binary, simply call it with the name of a file you wish to read (like "flag.txt") as the 1st argument.

### Challenge 5: [[badchars]] [0%] (Finish)
> An arbitrary write challenge with a twist; certain input characters get mangled as they make their way onto the stack. Find a way to deal with this and craft your exploit.
