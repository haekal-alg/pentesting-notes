#### .text (read only)
The `.text` section contains the actual assembler instructions of the program. 

#### .data
The `.data` section contains <span class=red>global</span> and <span class=red>static</span> variables.

#### .bss
Part of the data segment, which contains statically allocated variables represented exclusively by 0 bits.

#### The Heap
This area starts at the end of the `.bss` segment and <span class=red>grows</span> to the <span class=red>higher memory</span> addresses.

#### The Stack
Stack memory is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure in which the <span class=red>return addresses, parameters,</span> and, depending on the compiler options,<span class=red> frame pointers</span> are stored. 

C/C++ <span class=red>local variables</span> are stored here, and you can even copy code to the stack.

The contents are accessed via the `stack pointer`, set to the upper end of the stack during initialization. During execution, the allocated part of the stack <span class=red>grows down </span>to the <span class=red>lower memory addresses</span>.
